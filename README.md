News Scraper



This app allows users to view articles from reddit, save their favorites onto another page, and comment on their favorites. Each article displayed includes a headline which is also a link to the source article. There is a "Clear Articles" button next to "Saved Articles", but currently it does not work. The app uses Node/Express for the server and routing, MongoDB/Mongoose for the database and models, HTML and CSS for layouts, & Cheerio/Request for scraping the data from www.reddit.com.
